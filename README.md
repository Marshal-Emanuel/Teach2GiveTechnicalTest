    - Description: A program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz"; and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

2. **FizzBuzz C++**
    - File: `FizzBuzz C++.c++`
    - Description: Another implementation of the FizzBuzz program in C++.

3. **Power of 2 Checker**
    - File: `Power2.c++`
    - Description: A program that checks if a given integer is a power of 2.

4. **Fibonacci Sequence**
    - File: `FibonacciSequence.c++`
    - Description: A program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain limit.

5. **Integer Reverse**
    - File: `ReverseInteger.c++`
    - Description: A program that takes an integer as input and prints its digits in reverse order.

6. **Capitalizer**
    - File: `Capitalizer.c++`
    - Description: A program that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.

## How to Use

Each program can be compiled and run using a C++ compiler such as g++.

```bash
g++ program_name.c++ -o program_name
./program_name
